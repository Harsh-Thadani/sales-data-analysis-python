## Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs various steps in sales data analysis. The main goals include cleaning the data, merging monthly datasets, and performing analysis to answer business-related questions.

## Setup and Installation
To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-data-analysis.git
   cd sales-data-analysis
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Steps in the Analysis

### 1. Import Libraries
The first step is to import necessary Python libraries like pandas and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

### 2. Merge Monthly Data
- Combine sales data from individual monthly files into a single dataset.
- Save the merged dataset as a new CSV file for further processing.

### 3. Data Cleaning
- Drop rows with missing values (`NaN`).
- Remove invalid entries and format columns as required.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze sales trends over time.
- Identify top-performing products and cities.
- Calculate correlations between features.

### 5. Visualization
- Create bar charts, line plots, and histograms to visualize sales trends and insights.

### 6. Answer Business Questions
Examples of questions addressed in this notebook include:
- What is the best time of day to maximize sales?
- Which city has the highest sales?
- What products are most frequently sold together?

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (see [Setup and Installation](#setup-and-installation)).
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `SalesDataAnalysis.ipynb`.
3. Run each cell sequentially to perform the analysis.
